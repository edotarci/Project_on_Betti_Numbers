# Project_on_Betti_Numbers
- Computational and combinatorial methods for Betti Numbers of weighted trees.
- Developed an algorithm in Python, based on a combinatorial approach, to evaluate Betti Numbers for weighted and non-weighted chains.
- Supervisors: prof. Roberto Notari (PoliMi) and prof. Paolo Lella (PoliMi).
- Independent study of Graph Theory and Algebra.
