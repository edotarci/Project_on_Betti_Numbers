# Computational and combinatorial methods for Betti Numbers of weighted trees.
- Results: I developed, together with Lorenzo Varesio, an algorithm in Python, based on a combinatorial approach, to evaluate Betti Numbers for weighted and non-weighted chains.
- Supervisors: prof. Roberto Notari (PoliMi) and prof. Paolo Lella (PoliMi).

The idea of the project is to study the behavior of Betti numbers in weighted trees as the weights' values and their positions vary. Our contribution has specifically focused on studying chain graphs using computational methods in Python based on combinatorial considerations. 

The references, divided by topic, we had to delve to proceed tin the project are:
- Discrete Mathematics: Definition of graph, weighted graph, and tree.
- Algebra: Rings, modules, polynomial ideals, minimal free resolution, Betti numbers.
- Edge Ideal of a weighted and unweighted graph (https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0410107.pdf, https://rb.gy/u7wur).
