# Computational and combinatorial methods for Betti Numbers of weighted trees.
- Results: I developed, together with Lorenzo Varesio, an algorithm in Python, based on a combinatorial approach, to evaluate Betti Numbers for weighted and non-weighted chains.
- Supervisors: prof. Roberto Notari (PoliMi) and prof. Paolo Lella (PoliMi).
